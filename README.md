Parse.com ERD tool

A tool designed to create Parse.com entity relation diagrams based on the current schema. The tool uses the client side javascript library which has had a number of functions overriden in order to use the schema api from the javascript API in the browser. ERDs can either be built using the JSON schema export from the data brower in Parse.com or can be auto generated using your application key and master key (The master key is only using in your browser and is not saved anywhere. All code related to this project is only used in your browser.)

This project can be used as just a straight HTML file run locally if you wish, but the project files in this git repository are for deploying to a Parse.com cloud server.

The next step will be to clean up the code.
